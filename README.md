# data-structures are important skill every programmer should know.

# in this folder it contains various algorithms and datastructures i used to train on profeciency in this

# Bubble sort

- in this algorithm it must loop through the aray n-times comapring value next to it , so for n values there must be n comparisons
- time complexity of bubble sort is O(n2)
# Selection sort
- algorithim finds lowest value in an array and moves it to front of an array
# linear search
- it goes through value by value to find the index of the value it searches for
# Inventory management system for small store to showcase our practice in data structures
- we will use a Dictionary to store items, itmes anems will be the key and value will be a dictionary containing quantiy and price

# JSON
- json.dumps() : Converts a Python object into a JSON string.
- json.loads(): Parses a JSON string and converts it into a Python object.
- json.dump(): Serializes a Python object as a JSON formatted stream to a file.
- json.load(): Deserializes a JSON formatted stream from a file to a Python object.
